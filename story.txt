Once upon a time, there was a little seahorse named Jerry. Jerry was a brave seahorse who rode into battle with his fellow seahoreses,
in the great seahorse war of 1380930 BAE.  One day Jerry met an enemy seahorse who was wounded on the battle field. The enemy
was clearly in no condition to attack or wound Jerry so he slowly sauntered up to the foe.  Jerry looked down on the seahorse
and to his shock he realized that he recognized the poor soul.  It was Marcus of Bayfield one of Jerry's neighbors before the 
great seahorse war had begun.  Jerry looked down and felt sad for his former friend.  Alas, this was a battle and it seemed Jerry
only had two options when it came to the traitor.
